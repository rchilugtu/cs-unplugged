- Make a variable called `number_of_dots` and set its value to the input entered by the end user. Below is the algorithm to help you program this:

    If `number_of_dots` less than or equal to 31
      If `number_of_dots` greater than or equal to 16
        Subtract 16 from `number_of_dots` and display `16`
      If `number_of_dots` greater than or equal to 8
        Subtract 8 from `number_of_dots` and display `8`
      If `number_of_dots` greater than or equal to 4
        Subtract 4 from `number_of_dots` and display `4`
      If `number_of_dots` greater than or equal to 2
        Subtract 2 from `number_of_dots` and display `2`
      If `number_of_dots` greater than or equal to 1
        Subtract 1 from `number_of_dots` and display `1`
    else
      Ask the end user to enter a number less than or equal to `31`
    

- An if statement checks if the statement is true and if it is executes the lines inside In this challenge you need to use if statements to check if the `number_of_dots` is greater than or equal to 16 (use '>=') If it is, display card "16" and subtract 16 from your number and do the same with the rest of the cards.
- You can use 'else' to do something if the statement is false
