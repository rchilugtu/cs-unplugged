- Make a variable called `total_number_of_dots` and set its value to 0. Make a variable called `cards` and set its value to the input entered by the end user (5 black and white cards).
- Check each letter of the string and if it’s ‘W’ add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first letter, 8 for the second letter and so on) to the `total_number_of_dots`.
- Display the `total_number_of_dots` as the output.
- You can access a letter at the specified position in a string by using cards[index], where index is the position of the character you want. For example, if some_string = 'word', some_string[2] is 'r' and some_string[0] is 'w'.
