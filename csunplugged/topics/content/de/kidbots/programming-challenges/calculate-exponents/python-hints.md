- Make a variable called `base` and set its value to the base number entered by the user. This is the number that will be multiplied by.
- Make a variable called `power` and set its value to the power number entered by the user. This determines how many times to repeat the multiplication.
- Make a third variable called `result` and set its value to `1` multiplied by `base`, `power` times.

Note that python has a build in power function, so technically a loop is not necessary. For this lesson, use a loop, but for future reference, in Python, `5 ** 2` means 5^2.
