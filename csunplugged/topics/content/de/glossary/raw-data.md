# Raw data

Raw data means 'unprocessed data' which has been collected from a source, and has not been cleaned up or used yet. For example, say you had measured the temperature every day of the year, and now you have a bunch of numbers, this could be called your ‘unprocessed data’. If you then divided this data into each month of the year, and averaged it so you had the average temperature for each month, this would be your ‘processed data’.
