- Make variables called:
    
    - `total_number_of_dots` and set its value to the number entered by the end user.
    - `bit_value` and set its value to 1. Double its value until it is bigger than `total_number_of_dots`.
    - `bits` and set its value to 0. Every time that you double `bit_value` you need to add a new bit for storing the number (increase the value of `bits` by 1).

- Use a while loop to repeat the lines as long as `total_number_of_dots` is greater than or equal to `bit_value`. Display the value of `bits` as the output.

- Set the variable `bit_value` to 1 and double it until it is bigger than `total_number_of_dots`. Every time that you double `bit_value` you need to add a new bit for storing the number. Use a while loop to repeat these steps until the condition is no longer true In this challenge you need to repeat the blocks while `total_number_of_dots` is greater than or equal to `bit_value`.
- Test your program with some values on the boundaries (for example number 31 would need 5 bits and 32 needs 6 bits).
