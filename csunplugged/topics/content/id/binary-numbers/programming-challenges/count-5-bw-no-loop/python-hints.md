- Make a variable called `total_number_of_dots` and set it to 0.
- Add the corresponding number of dots (16 for the first input, 8 for the second input and so on) to the `total_number_of_dots` every time the end user enters ‘W’ as the input.
- You will need to use 5 if statements for this
- Use an equals operator to set the new value of your variable, and an addition operator to add to it
