- To simulate a coin toss, use the `random` package:

```python
import random
coin = random.randint(1, 2)
```

Which will give you either a 1 or a 2 randomly. - To calculate the percentages of getting heads (or tails), multiply the total number of heads (or tails) by 100 then divide it by the total number of coin flips (entered as the input by the user).
