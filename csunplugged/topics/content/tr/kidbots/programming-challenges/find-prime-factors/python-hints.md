- You need to find the factors of the number (see [challenge 4.1]('topics:programming_challenge' 'kidbots' 'check-if-divisor')) and check each factor to see if itâ€™s a prime number (see [challenge 4.2]('topics:programming_challenge' 'kidbots' 'check-if-divisor-series')). Add the factors which are also prime numbers to a list called `prime_factors`.
