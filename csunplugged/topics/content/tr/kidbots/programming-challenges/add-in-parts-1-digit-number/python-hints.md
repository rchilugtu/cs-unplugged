- Make two variables called `num1` and `num2` and set their values to the inputs entered by the user.
- To make `num1` a tidy number, split `num2` into 2 parts (call these variables `10_minus_num1` and `left_from_num2`) so the sum of one part and `num1` is equal to 10.
- Remember that to display a number in a `print()` statement with text, you have to cast the number to a string, using `str(num1)`. To display other text with it, you can use `str(num1) + ' + ' + str(num2)`
