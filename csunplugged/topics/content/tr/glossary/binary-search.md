# Binary search

An algorithm that tells us how to efficiently find a specific value in an **ordered (sorted)** list. It is called 'binary' search because each time you look at a value in the list you divide the list into 2 parts, one is discarded and the other is kept. The word "binary" here just means something that has two parts, such as a binary star system (made of two stars); binary search shouldn't be confused with binary numbers.
