# Sequential search

A sequential search is when you look at each piece of data, one by one, and donâ€™t stop until you find what you are looking for. You can use a sequential search on any data, whether it is sorted or unsorted (though it would be potentially a slow way to locate what you are looking for if the data is in sorted order!) However, sequential search is the **only** option you can use when you need to search through data that is **unsorted**.
