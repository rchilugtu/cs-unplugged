# Data

The way information is stored. Numbers are a type of data you will come across very often (e.g. account numbers, customer numbers, card numbers, serial numbers, product numbers and so on). It could also be text (such as words that we're searching for), dates, and even images and sound. You can think of anything stored in a computer's memory as data; itâ€™s all pieces of information.
