- Make variables called `original_time` and `hours_to_add` and set their values to the inputs entered by the user. Make a variable called `new_time` and set its value to the sum of the `original_time` and `hours_to_add`. Keep subtracting 12 from the `new_time` until the `new_time` is less than or equal to 12. Display the value of the `new_time` as the output.
