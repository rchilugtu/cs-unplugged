- Make variables called:
    
    - `decimal_number` and set its value to the input number given by the end user.
    - `bit_value` and set its value to 32.

- Now divide the `bit_value` by 2 and check if `decimal_number` is greater than or equal to `bit_value`. If it is, print 'high' for a high note and subtract `bit_value` from `decimal_number`. If not, print 'low' for a low note Repeat while `bit_value` is greater than 1.

- Test your program with some values on the boundaries (for example test it with numbers 0 and 31).
