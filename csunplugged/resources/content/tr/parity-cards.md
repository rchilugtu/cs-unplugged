# Parity Cards

This resource contains printouts for parity card activities. To use this resource:

- Print the PDF double sided.
- Printing on 120 gsm card also can be useful.

Each page contains 20 parity cards, so we recommend printing at least 2 pages of cards as 40 cards is a useful number for most activities.
